# EAT-DA-BURGER (Sequelized)

## This app allows a user to create a burger and devour that burger. 

This app was created by Brian Nickila, following strict guidelines by the University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp course using Sequelize, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, Node.js, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

User can type a burger into the create burger field and click the submit button. The burger will show up in the New Burgers section with an option to devour. If devoured, the burger gets place in the eaten burgers section.

This app has been deployed to the Heroku server where the database can be accessed and modified.
